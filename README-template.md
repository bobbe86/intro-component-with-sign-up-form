## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to take away and reformat code to make a cleaner project with less filler and usless code. 


### Continued development

CSS selectors
JS is still a mystery to me, I can read it but actually implementing and reconfiguring code is challenging



### Useful resources

- [Florin Pop YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rsd4FNGTRBw) - This helped me for the error messages and all the JS id from this video
- [Florin Pop Codepen](https://codepen.io/bobby-salazar/pen/VwBMBRB) - The corresponding codepen for the video
